# Research


# Summary 

My research is focused on analyzing the dynamics of extreme events and their consequences on the environment. For this task I am using a particular Machine Learning family of models, called Reservoir Computing. More broadly, my interests vary from applications of Machine Learning, to Dynamical Systems and Self Organization. I like every thing computational, and odds are if something has to do with programming I am going to enjoy it.
