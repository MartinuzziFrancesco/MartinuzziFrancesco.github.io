# Introduction

Hello there! I am Francesco Martinuzzi, a PhD student in Physics and Earth Sciences at Leipzig University in Germany. I am under the supervision of Prof. [Miguel D. Mahecha](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/profile/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-miguel-dario-mahecha-ordonez/) and Dr. [Karin Mora](https://aperiodik.is/) at the Remote Sensing Centre for Earth System Research [RSC4Earth](https://rsc4earth.de/). My research is kindly funded by the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai/).

I am also working part time as a consultant for [Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com/), where I contributed in the development of [JuliaSim](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliasim/), a Machine-Learning powered simulation platform. 

In my PhD project I explore the consequences of extreme events on the environment using Machine Learning models. More specifically I am interested in leveraging Reservoir Computing for this task. My master thesis, titled _On complexity and computational power of Elementary Cellular Automata using Reservoir Computing_, explored the criticality of these models using Information Theory approaches. 

I have taken part in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2020 project with [Julia](https://julialang.org/) organization working on an implementation of a Reservoir Computing library. [Here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5374375945043968) you can find a brief description of the project. Most of the posts in my website detail the progress during the three months of the program.
