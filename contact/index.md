I have a plethora of email accounts apparently, so the following are only for specific questions:
- **francesco(at)juliacomputing(dot)com** for anything _work_ related.
- **martinuzzi(at)informatik(dot)uni-leipzig(dot)de** for anything _academic_ related.

If you just want to say hello or want me to answer faster, the most reliable way to contact me is to write at one of the following:
- Mail: **martinuzzi(dot)francesco(at)gmail(dot)com** 
- Telegram: **(at)martinuzzifrancesco** 

where (dot) = . and (at) = @
